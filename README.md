# React Portfolio [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

    
    
## Description

This is the remodeled portfolio assignment made with react. I created a baseline template to add further projects to as I progress. Some of the work space is empty as I will be adding stuff throughout the year. The welcome page should send a link to the next page. The contact form will need to be updated with the ability to save the input form.
